## Welcome to Ramapriya's Data Scince Project Portfolio
This Repository containing portfolio of data science projects completed by me for academic, self learning purposes to track my progress in AI/Data Science.The projects are from Machine learning,Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing(NLP).

## Computer Vision
[Identify_Blood_Cell_Subtypes_From_Images](https://github.com/ramapriyakp/Portfolio/blob/master/CV/Identify_Blood_Cell_Subtypes_From_Images.ipynb)
<p>Use computer vision techniques to automate methods to detect and classify blood cell subtypes. Trained a convolutional neural network (CNN) for classifying blood cell subtypes. Used Keras Sequential API to define CNN network and classify blood cell subtypes. Achieved Test accuracy of 95% for two class classification by nucleii number and 75% accuracy for four class classification by cell type</p>
[Kangaroo_detect](https://github.com/ramapriyakp/Portfolio/blob/master/CV/Kangaroo_detect.ipynb)
<p>Use Object detection technique to identify presence, location, and type of one or more objects in a given image. Mask R-CNN model pre-fit on MS COCO object detection dataset is used and then trained to the kangaroo dataset. The model is used as-is, wirh  class-specific output layers removed so that new output layers can be defined and trained. Trained Mask R-CNN with resnet101 architecture to achieve Test mAP of 0.967</p>
